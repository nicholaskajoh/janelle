# Janelle [WIP]
Janelle (pronounced *ya-nel*) is a simple SQL database written in Java. The goal of this project is to learn how databases work by building one.

## Features
- Interact with DB via REPL.
- Run basic SQL queries (see section below).
- Index columns for faster queries.
- Start and commit/roll back transactions.

## Setup
- Clone repo.
- Build `./gradlew buildRepl`.
- Run `java -jar repl/build/libs/repl.jar`.

## Queries
- CRUD table
- CRUD data
- Aggregate data (count, sum, average, group by)
- Join tables

## REPL commands
- `.EXIT`: Exit REPL.
